# MiniRISC-Web-Editor
Recreating the MiniRISC editor in the browser.

## Goals:
* Creating a nice web editor with monaco-editor
* Writing a MiniRISC-Assembly compiler
* Live syntax check
* Ability to run code and see the result on the several displays

### Disclaimer:
MiniRISC is not my idea and I have no intention of using it for anything other than educational and recreational purposes.
